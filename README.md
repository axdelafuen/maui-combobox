# Maui.DropDown

Building a .net Maui application and I needed something that was not a picker and that would allow me to select data. 

There is no DropDown or ComboBox available in .net Maui as you would normally use the 'Picker' controls as this is normal for iOS, but the Picker does not seem to work well on MacCatalyst and there are issues with the current Picker implementation. 

So I built a simple DropDown control. Feel free to use as you see fit.
