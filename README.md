# Maui.DropDown

Building a .net Maui application and I needed something that was not a picker and that would allow me to select data. There is no DropDown or ComboBox available in .net Maui as you would use the normal Picker controls but they don;t work so well in Catalyst. So I built a simple DropDown control. Feel free to use as you see fit.
